= Migrating Content to Pulp 3

The time to prepare content for Pulp 3 depends on the amount of content.
For large systems, this can mean several days of downtime.

Use this procedure to begin migrating content from Pulp 2 to Pulp 3.

.Procedure

. View details of the content you are migrating using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content migration-stats
----
+
Use this command as often as necessary during the migration process to determine how long the process will take.
It also identifies corrupted or missing content that might cause the migration to fail.
Output is similar to the following:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]

Note: ensure there is sufficient storage space for /var/lib/pulp/published to
double in size before starting the migration process.
Check the size of /var/lib/pulp/published with 'du -sh /var/lib/pulp/published/'

. Update the file permissions before the {ProjectServer} upgrade using the following:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} prep-{TargetVersion}-upgrade
----
+
This might take some time on high latency systems.
. Prepare your content for Pulp migration using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content-prepare
----
+
If you know the process will take some time you can use the following command to terminate the process gracefully, whenever necessary, so that you can continue later.
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content-prepare abort
----
+
. Continue the migration process when convenient using `{foreman-maintain} content-prepare`.
. The migration process is not fully complete until the upgrade of {ProjectServer} from {ProjectVersionPrevious} to {ProjectVersion} is complete.
