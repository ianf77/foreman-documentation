The webhook HTTP payload must be created using {Project} template syntax.
The subject of the event is available using the `@object` variable.
{Project} ships with an example template for every single event available.
For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.9/html/managing_hosts/appe-red_hat_satellite-managing_hosts-template_writing_reference[Template Writing Reference] in _Managing Hosts_ and for available template macros and methods, visit `/templates_doc` on {ProjectServer}.

Webhooks were not designed to call generic APIs.
It is not possible to write any logic in templates for example making multiple HTTP requests per event.
The intention is to call a third-party web service that provides the necessary logic to complete the integration.
For simple tasks, there is a {SmartProxy} plugin to write custom shell scripts.
