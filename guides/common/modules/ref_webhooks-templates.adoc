A webhook HTTP payload must be created using {Project} template syntax.
The subject of the event is available using the `@object` variable.
{Project} ships with an example template for every single event available.
For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.9/html/managing_hosts/appe-red_hat_satellite-managing_hosts-template_writing_reference[Template Writing Reference] in _Managing Hosts_ and for available template macros and methods, visit `/templates_doc` on {ProjectServer}.

Webhooks are not designed to call generic APIs.
The intention is to call a third-party web service providing the necessary logic to complete the integration.
For simple tasks, there is a {SmartProxy} plugin you can write custom shell scripts for.
