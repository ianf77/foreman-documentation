With webhooks one {Project} event can only be mapped to one API call.
For advanced integrations, where a single shell script can contain multiple commands, you can install a {SmartProxy} shellhooks plugin that exposes executables using a REST HTTPS API.

A webhook can then be configured to reach out to a {SmartProxy} API to run a predefined shellhook, which can contain commands or can edit files.

Scripts must be placed in `/var/lib/foreman-proxy/shellhooks` as executables with only alphanumeric characters and underscores in the name.

The HTTPS payload is passed using standard input, optional command line arguments can be provided using X-Shellhook-Arg-1 _to_ N.

The HTTP method must be POST.
An example URL would be: `\https://{smartproxy-example-com}:{smartproxy_port}/shellhooks/my_script`.

Select the *Proxy Authorization* check box to enable each webhook to authorize a call.

Standard output and error are redirected to the {SmartProxy} log as messages with debug or warning levels respectively.

There is no return value from shellhook HTTPS calls.
