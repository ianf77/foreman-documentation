| Setting | Value | Description
| *Host owner* | Empty | Default owner on provisioned hosts, if empty {Project} uses the current user.
| *Root password* | \\***** | Default encrypted root password on provisioned hosts.
| *Unattended URL* |  | URL that hosts retrieve templates from during build.
When it starts with https unattended/userdata controllers cannot be accessed using HTTP.
| *Safemode rendering* | `Yes` | Enables safe mode rendering of provisioning templates.
The default and recommended option `Yes` denies the access to variables and any object that is not listed in Satellite.

When set to `No`, any object may be accessed by a user with permission to use templating features, either by editing templates, parameters or smart variables.
This permits users full remote code execution on {ProjectServer}, effectively disabling all authorization.
This is not a safe option, especially in bigger companies.
| *Access unattended without build* | No | Enable access to unattended URLs without build mode being used.
| *Query local nameservers* | No | {Project} queries the locally configured resolver instead of the SOA/NS authorities.
| *Installation token lifetime* | 360 | Time in minutes installation tokens should be valid for, 0 to disable token.
| *SSH timeout* | 120 | Time in seconds before SSH provisioning times out.
| *Libvirt default console address* | 0.0.0.0 | The IP address that should be used for the console listen address when provisioning new virtual machines using Libvirt.
| *Update IP from built request* | No | {Project} updates the host IP with the IP that made the built request.
| *Use short name for VMs* | No | {Project} uses the short hostname instead of the FQDN for creating new virtual machines.
| *DNS timeout* | [5, 10, 15, 20] | List of timeouts (in seconds) for DNS lookup attempts such as the dns_lookup macro and DNS record conflict validation
| *Clean up failed deployment* | Yes | {Project} deletes virtual machine if provisioning script ends with non zero exit code.
| *Type of name generator* | `Random-based` | Specifies the method used to generate a host name when creating a new host.

The default `Random-based` option generates a unique random host name which you can but do not have to use.
This is useful for users who create many hosts and do not know how to name them.

The `MAC-based` option is for bare-metal hosts only.
If you delete a host and create it later on, it receives the same host name based on the MAC address.
This can be useful for users who recycle servers and want them to always get the same host name.

The `Off` option disables the name generator function and leaves the host name field blank.
| *Default PXE global template entry* | Empty | Default PXE menu item in global template - `local`, `discovery` or custom, use blank for template default.
| *Default PXE local template entry* | Empty | Default PXE menu item in local template - `local`, `local_chain_hd0` or custom, use blank for template default.
| *iPXE intermediate script* | iPXE intermediate script | Intermediate iPXE script for unattended installations.
| *Destroy associated VM on host delete* | No | Destroy associated VM on host delete.
When enabled, VMs linked to Hosts will be deleted on Compute Resource.
When disabled, VMs are unlinked when the host is deleted, meaning they remain on Compute Resource and can be re-associated or imported back to {Project} again.
This does not automatically power off the VM
| *Maximum structured facts* | 100 | Maximum number of keys in structured subtree, statistics stored in {project-context}::dropped_subtree_facts
| *Default Global registration template* | Global Registration | Global Registration template.
| *Default 'Host initial configuration' template* | Linux host_init_config default | Default 'Host initial configuration' template, automatically assigned when a new operating system is created.
| *Global default PXEGrub2 template* | PXEGrub2 global default | Global default PXEGrub2 template.
This template is deployed to all configured TFTP servers.
It is not affected by upgrades.
| *Global default PXELinux template* | PXELinux global default | Global default PXELinux template.
This template is deployed to all configured TFTP servers.

| *Global default PXEGrub template* | PXEGrub global default | Global default PXEGrub template.

| *Global default iPXE template* | iPXE global default | Global default iPXE template.
